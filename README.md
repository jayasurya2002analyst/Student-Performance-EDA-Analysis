# Student-Performance-EDA-Analysis
Mini Project 3 | Student performance analysis using SQL &amp; Python EDA to understand the factors impacting exam success. 

# 🎓 Student Performance EDA (SQL + Python)

This repository contains a complete **Student Performance Analysis** project using SQL for data querying and Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
The aim is to understand what factors influence student exam performance and provide actionable insights for education stakeholders.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective  
To determine key drivers of student success by analysing:
- Gender
- Lunch type (indicates financial status)
- Parental education level
- Test preparation course completion  
Insights help educational institutions to design interventions and support students effectively.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **MySQL** – for SQL queries and data exploration  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – for data cleaning, feature engineering and visualisation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – documentation & execution environment  
- **GitHub** – version control and portfolio showcase

## 🔍 Summary of Insights  
- Female students perform better on average compared to male students.  
- Students having **standard lunch** type score higher than those with **free/reduced lunch**.  
- Students whose parents have higher education levels tend to score better.  
- Completing a test preparation course significantly improves performance.  
- Student performance shows strong correlation between subjects (reading ↔ writing).  

---

## 🚀 Conclusion  
This analysis provides actionable insights for schools and educators:
- Provide additional support for students from financial-challenged backgrounds (free/reduced lunch).  
- Promote and provide access to test preparation courses.  
- Engage parents with lower education levels in student development programs.
