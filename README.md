# Student-Performance-EDA-Analysis
Mini Project 3 | Student performance analysis using SQL &amp; Python EDA to understand the factors impacting exam success. 

# 🎓 Student Performance EDA (SQL + Python)

This project analyzes student exam performance and identifies the key factors affecting academic success using **SQL** and **Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective  
To understand **what factors influence student performance the most**, including:  
- Gender  
- Lunch type (financial background)  
- Parental education  
- Test preparation course completion  

These insights help **schools improve learning outcomes & support systems**.
